## Build and Installation

This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner and requires [Go](https://golang.org/) for building. Below are the available commands:

### Available Commands

- `just` or `just install` - Build and install the binary to `PREFIX/bin/` (default: `/usr/local/bin`)
- `just build` - Build the binary in the current directory
- `just uninstall` - Remove the installed binary
- `just clean` - Remove the built binary from the current directory

## Usage

```sh
tuit
```

## Authentication & Config

### First Time Setup

On first run, the app will guide you through Mastodon authentication:

```bash
$ tuit
Enter the URL of your Mastodon server: mastodon.social
Open your browser and visit the authorization URL...
Paste the code here: [paste-code-from-browser]
```

### Config Locations

Credentials are automatically saved to:

| OS          | Location                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linux**   | `~/.config/tuit/config.json`                     |
| **macOS**   | `~/Library/Application Support/tuit/config.json` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\tuit\config.json`                     |

### How It Works

1. First run → OAuth2 flow with Mastodon
2. Credentials saved to OS config directory
3. Subsequent runs → Auto load from config file

The app handles all authentication automatically and stores your access token for future use.

### Security Notes

- Credentials are stored in plain text in the user's config directory
- The config directory has permissions set to `0755` (readable by user only on Unix systems)
- Access tokens have "read write" scope for full Mastodon functionality
- Users should protect their config directory from unauthorized access

### Troubleshooting

If authentication fails:

1. Delete the config file and restart the app to re-authenticate
2. Check that the Mastodon server URL is correct and accessible
3. Verify the authorization code was copied correctly during setup
